                                <p>How effective are your marketing activities? Is your marketing investment providing the return of sales you expect?</p>
                                <p>It is critical for a Marketeer to understand immediately the response during your marketing campaign. Utilising TM ViSight Reports would be the most efficient way to measure the effectiveness of your campaign activities and to identify geographically, where your campaign is being successful. More importantly, where you campaign it is not being successful - enabling you to protect your ROI and change activities where necessary.</p>
                                <p>The most recent information will be available to you at 8:00am everyday enhancing your management tools, enabling you to make immediate decisions to maximize the value of your marketing expenses.</p>
                                <p>Example: Is the marketing campaign generating the number of responses as expected? If not, you may want to evaluate the campaign whether the messages are making the impact you want, have chosen the right channel or have you reached your target audience?</p>
                                <h3>State Region Summary</h3>
                                <p>State Region Summary provides most updated information on where your response is coming from by State and Region. The TM ViSight report allows you to easily compare the response with the population within the State. If you have implemented a nationwide campaign, this will allow you to understand which State gives the most response to your campaign and which States generate lesser calls considering the number of population.</p>
                                <p>For any campaign to be successful you may want to ensure your company have enough resources within these areas to manage response levels and subsequently successful sales.</p>
                                <h3>Exchange Area Summary</h3>
                                <p>This report shows exactly where the callers are originating from with each region, city and drilling down further to suburb. The report enables you to determine if the response is from the target market, compare response to actual sales, and which area did not respond.</p>
                                <p>Example: If you have a ground activity in Bangsar yesterday, do you see an increase in number of calls coming from Bangsar? If you have implemented a nationwide campaign, you can easily identify where the responses are coming from and what areas we not so successful.&nbsp;</p>
